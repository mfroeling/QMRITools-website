The `SegmentData` function within the `QMRITools` package is designed to automatically segment lower extremity muscles of healthy subjects of the hip, thigh, and leg. This function is an essential tool in the [Segmentationtools](https://www.qmritools.com/tool/segmentationtools) package, leveraging advanced neural networks for precise muscle segmentation.

## Function Overview for muscle segmentation

`SegmentData` employs four neural networks:

- **Side and Location Recognition:** Two networks identify the side (left/right) and location (hip/thigh/leg) of the muscles.
- **Muscle Segmentation:** Two networks perform the detailed segmentation of the muscles.

{% include page-image im_id="flow" %}

The networks are trained on 20 manually segmented thigh and leg datasets and currently operate on out-phase gradient echo images, which can be acquired or reconstructed using Dixon-based methods. The implementation supports any data size, with optimal performance on images with an in-plane resolution of 1-2.5 mm and a slice thickness of 5-10 mm. The latest trained networks are available as `.wlnet` files within the [QMRItools package](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases) package, and `.ONNX` files can be requested.

## Architecture and Training

The segmentation networks are based on the UNET architecture with ResNet convolution blocks that contain short skip connections. The block diagrams of the encoding and decoding blocks used in our UNET architecture are shown below.

## Data Augmentation and Training

For training, data is heavily augmented using various techniques such as scale, skew, rotation, translation, noise, sharpen, contrast, and brightness adjustments. Training is conducted with a batch size of 2 and a patch size of 32x112x112 voxels, with 256 datasets seen per epoch. Patches are selected after data augmentation. Training typically continues for 200-300 epochs, taking approximately 8-12 hours. Below are examples of the first 100 epochs for the upper and lower leg. The resulting segmentations from both networks are displayed.
