Everyting in QMRITools can also run from the command line using the Wolfram engine.
For segmentation there are dedicated scripts that install and run the segmentation software.
Below is a short manual on how to use these tools. The scripts and so example data can be found [here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/tree/master/scripts).

## Wolfram engine and script

- Install the free Wolfram Engine as described here:
<https://www.wolfram.com/engine/>
<https://support.wolfram.com/45743>
- Install WolframScript as described here
<https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/InstallWolframScript.html>

## QMRITools

Install QMRITools for the worlfram enging using the `Install_QMRITools.wls` WolframScript.

The latest release link needed for the command line command can be found on the releases [page](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases).

``` bash
wolframscript -f "path to file\Install_QMRITools.wls" https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases/download/4.x.x/QMRITools-4.x.x.paclet
```

For the situation where you run the scrip from its own folder with the test folder also there this will be script

``` bash
wolframscript -f "Install_QMRITools.wls" https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases/download/4.x.x/QMRITools-4.x.x.paclet
```

## Segmentation script

Run the segmentation script (networks are currelty for out-phase dixon data):

``` bash
wolframscript -f "path to file\Segment_Nii.wls" "file to be segmented.nii.gz" "output file.nii"
```

For the situation where you run the scrip from its own folder with the test folder also there this will be script

``` bash
wolframscript -f "Segment_Nii.wls" "test data\test_up.nii.gz" "test data\out_up.nii"
```

``` bash
wolframscript -f "Segment_Nii.wls" "test data\test_low.nii.gz" "test data\out_low.nii"
```

By default the CPU is used, if you want to switch to GPU open the script in any text editor and change "CPU" for "GPU".
