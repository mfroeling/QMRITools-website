`QMRITools` contains various toolboxes dedicated to various quantitative MRI techniques. It supports import and export of various file formats, but the main file format on which the tools are build is *.nii. The main focus is on Diffusion tensor imaging, extended phase graph based T2 mapping, Dixon reconstruction and phosphorus spectroscopy. It also contains some general function for de-noising of multidimensional data, masking and data processing.

A notebook listing all functions in each toolbox and their full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/tree/master/QMRITools/Resources/All-Functions.nb){:target="_blank"}. All toolboxes are listed below and under each link a short description of each toolbox is given.
