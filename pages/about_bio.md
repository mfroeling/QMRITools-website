I am an Assistant Professor at the University Medical Center Utrecht and part of the precision imaging group (https://research.umcutrecht.nl/research-groups/precision-imaging/) within the [High field MRI research group](https://research.umcutrecht.nl/research-groups/high-field-mri-research-group/). My journey in the field of MRI technology began with a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2009, followed by a Ph.D. in Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the human forearm at the Amsterdam University Medical Center and the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012. Since then, I have been part of UMC Utrecht, initially as a postdoctoral researcher and from 2018, as an [Assistant Professor](https://research.umcutrecht.nl/researchers/martijn-froeling/).

I am particularly interested in developing MRI methods that have clear clinical applications. I believe that these techniques are only truly valuable if they are accessible and usable by others in the field. My research covers various areas, including the brain, peripheral nerves, muscle, kidney, and heart, with a focus on quantitative MRI. Throughout my career, I have contributed to the field, particularly through the development of [QMRITools](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools), a toolbox for quantitative MRI data analysis. My efforts in this area were recognized in 2023 with the Best Open Source Tool Award from the [Quantitative MR Study Group of the ISMRM](https://groups.ismrm.org/quantitative-mr/) and the [Wolfram Innovator Award](https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/innovator-award/2023/martijn-froeling/).

Currently, I am focused on my Vidi grant project, which involves building a database of 180 healthy subjects. This project collects whole leg quantitative MRI data, force measurements, and lifestyle questionnaires to study the relationship between muscle architecture, microstructure, and function. More details about this project can be found at [muscle-atlas.org](https://www.muscle-atlas.org/).

My work aims to [advance scientific understanding](https://researchinformation.umcutrecht.nl/en/persons/martijn-froeling/publications/) of quantitative MRI methods while ensuring practical clinical applications, reflecting my commitment to improving medical imaging through accessible and useful methods.
