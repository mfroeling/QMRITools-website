Martijn Froeling has done his master's (July 2009) in Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and Performed his PdD studies on Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the human forearm at the Amsterdam University Medical Center and the Eindhoven University of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ir. Klaas Nicolay, Prof. Dr. Ir. Gustav Strijkers and Prof. Dr. Ir. Aart Nederveen. Since his Ph.D. (Oktober 2012) he has continued his work on quantitative MRI in various organs such as the brain, peripheral nerves, muscle, kidney, and heart. Since July 2012 he works at the High Field group of the University Medical Center focussing on coil and hardware development for 7T systems and multi-nuclei imaging and clinical studies into neuromuscular diseases. Throughout his career, he has developed and maintained [QMRITools](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools) for Mathematica, a toolbox for quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data of muscle, nerve, and heart. In 2021, he was awarded an NWO Vidi grant. In this project, he will study the relation between muscle architecture, microstructure, and function using multiparametric quantitative MRI.
