Import and export of the NIfTI file format. Part of the code is based on
previously implemented
[nii-converter](https://github.com/tomdelahaije/nifti-converter). For
converting DICOM data to the NIfTI file format the toolbox uses
[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases). It also
provides some specialized NIfTI import functions for specific
experiments which are probably not generalizable. [Back››](/tool/)
