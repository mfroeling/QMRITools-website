A collection of tools to evaluate and visualize complex multi-coil data. The functions
are specific for analysis of multi-coil magnitude and noise data which
allows quantifying per channel SNR. Furthermore, if complex coil
sensitivity maps are available it allows performing SENSE g-factor maps
simulations. [Back››](/tool/)
