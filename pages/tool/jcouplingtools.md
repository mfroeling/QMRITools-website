A toolbox that allows simulation of NMR spectra using Hamiltonians based
on methods from [FID-A](https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A). It allows
simulating large spin systems (Castillo et al. 2011) and was initially implemented
to investigate fat spectra in TSE acquisitions of muscle (Stokes et al.
2013). However its most prominent application now is to generate basis spectra for
fitting acquired MRS data. [Back››](/tool/)
