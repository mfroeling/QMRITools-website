import and export of various file formats, but the main fileformat on which the tools are build is *.nii. The main focus is on Diffusion tensor imaging, extended phase graph based T2 mapping, Dixon reconstruction and phosphorus spectroscopy. It also contains some general function for de-noising of multidimensional data, masking and data processing.
