The toolbox always works within the latest version of 
Mathematica and does not support any backward
compatibility. After the toolbox is installed correctly it should show
up as a package in the Mathematica add-ons.

A notebook with all functions and their description can be found [here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/blob/master/QMRITools/All-Functions.nb){:target="_blank"}.
Documentation of all functions and their options is fully integrated in
the Mathematica documentation. An online version of the full documentation can be 
found [here](../../assets/htmldoc/guide/QMRITools.html){:target="_blank"}.
