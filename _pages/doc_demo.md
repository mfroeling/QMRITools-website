The release contains a zip file
[DemoAndTest.zip](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases/download/2.0/DemoAndTest.zip)
in which there is a file `demo.nb`, a folder `DemoData` and a folder
`Testing`. To have a global overview of the functionality of the toolbox
you can download this folder and run the `demo.nb`. By default the
`demo.nb` looks for the folders `DemoData` and `Testing` in the same
folder as the notebook.

In the first section of the demo notebook the toolbox is loaded and two
tests are performed. The first test is to check of all files that are
needed to run the toolbox are present. The second test runs after the
toolbox is loaded and checks if all the functions and their options that
are defined are correct.
